# CMR Contribution Guidelines

## Code Formatting and Style
We do our best to ensure that the CMR is readable and easily maintainable, so in addition to adhering to good functional practice, we use these two style guides.
- For general Clojure style: https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide
- For namespacing: https://stuartsierra.com/2016/clojure-how-to-ns.html

## Testing
The CMR employs both unit testing, and integration testing. Unit tests should test small areas of code, preferably single functions, whereas integration tests should test the CMR through the API.

- Unit Testing
  - These follow the standard Leiningen test format, in addition to using clojure.test
  - Pure functions are functions that modify no external state or rely on external state to execute. They operate only on the data passed in as arguments and return new data. These are the easiest kinds of functions to test
  - Mocking is hard to get right, makes test brittle, and often misses testing crucial things

    - https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html

- Integration Testing
  - The state before each integration test is reset using a fixture that sends a request to reset the application to its initial state.
  - Integration tests should test an application or the whole system as a black box. They shouldn't manipulate underlying resources used by the application.

- Which to use, unit or integration test?
  - Test as much as possible at the unit test level. Unit tests are easier to write, run faster, and will be narrowly focused so errors are found more easily.
  - Unit Tests are best for
    - testing pure logic like data manipulation or data conversion.
    - testing single functions.
  - Integration Tests are best for
    - testing integration of components in an application.
    - testing integration of applications in a system.

# Dependencies
The Common Metadata Repository is built using Clojure 1.8.0, with dependencies managed by Leiningen (version 2.5.1 or greater).
  - This also requires Java 1.8.0 or higher
  - We use Mac OSX 10.8 or greater and have had success installing Leiningen via Homebrew and the install script on the Leiningen website

Development and testing can be easily accomplished without the need to set up external Elasticsearch or OracleDB VMs.
The current in-memory configuration is the default and often preferred way to work on the CMR, as it is the easiest configuration to use, and will be sufficient in a large majority of cases.
