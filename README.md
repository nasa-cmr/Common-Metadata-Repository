# cmr-dev-system

Dev System combines together the separate microservices of the CMR into a single application to make it simpler to develop.

## Usage

  - Clone this project.
  - Clone all the dependent projects.
    - See the project.clj for the list.
  - Run `lein install` in each of the dependent projects
    - TODO eventually we can script this
  - Run `lein create-checkouts`
  - Make a config directory
    - Copy the elasticsearch_config.json file from the indexer here.
    - TODO we should have a better way to handle this. The path is local so that's why it must be in dev-system
      - I'll give someone a gold star if the fix this
  - Open a repl in sublime from this project.
