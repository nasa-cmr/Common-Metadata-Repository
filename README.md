# cmr-search-app

FIXME

## TODO

  * Draw informal design for this application
  * Test against indexed collections as indexed by catalog-rest
    * This will be a way to make it work before other components are complete.
    * Use curl requests to send searches.


## Example CURL requests


### Find all collections
```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -i "http://localhost:3000/collections"
```

### Find all collections with a bad parameter
```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -i "http://localhost:3000/collections?foo=5"
```

### Find all collections with a dataset id
```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -i "http://localhost:3000/collections.xml?dataset_id=DatasetId%204"
```

## Prerequisites
