## About

The Common Metadata Repository (CMR) is an earth science metadata repository
for [NASA](http://nasa.gov) [EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov) data. The CMR
Search API provides access to this metadata.

## Client-facing Components

- Search
  - Allows the user to search by collections, granules, and concepts with a
    myriad of different query types
  - API Docs: https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/search_api_docs.html

- Ingest
  - Ingest refers to the process of validating, inserting, updating, or
    deleting metadata in the CMR system and affects only the metadata for the specific Data Partner. The CMR allows Data Partners to ingest metadata
    records through a RESTful API
  - API Docs: https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/ingest/site/ingest_api_docs.html

- Access Control
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs) are the mechanism by which users are granted
    access to perform different operations in the CMR. CMR ACLs follow the same design as ECHO ACLs which in turn are derived from the generic ACL
    design pattern used in many other systems. At a high level, an ACL is a
    mapping of actors (subjects) to resources (object) to operations
    (predicate). For instance, a CMR ACL might specify that all Registered users have READ access to ASTER data or all users in a provider operations group have permissions to ingest data for a particular provider.

## Obtaining the Code

You can get the CMR source code by cloning the repository from Github:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:nasa/Common-Metadata-Repository.git cmr
```

## Building and Running the CMR

The CMR is a system consisting of multiple services. The services can be run
individually or can run in a single process. Running in a single process makes
local development easier because it avoids having to start many different
processes. The dev-system project allows the CMR to be run from a single REPL
or Jar file. If you're developing a client against the CMR you can build and
run the entire CMR with no external dependencies from this Jar file and use
that instance for local testing. The sections below contain instructions for
running the CMR as a single process or as multiple processes.

#### First Steps

1. Ensure you have installed on your system the items listed above in the
   "Prerequisites" section.
1. Download the Oracle JDBC `.jar` files into `./oracle-libs/support` by
   following instructions in `./oracle-lib/README.md`. (The CMR must have these
   libraries to build but it does not depend on Oracle DB when running
   locally. It uses a local in-memory database by default.)

#### Using the `cmr` CLI Tool

This project has its own tool that is used for everything from initial setup to
running buids and tests on the CI/CD infrastructure. In order to use the tool
as we do below, be sure to run the following from the top-level CMR directory:

```
export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bin
source resources/shell/cmr-bash-autocomplete
```

If you use another system shell, we'll except a PR with auto-complete for it.

#### Building and Running CMR Dev System in a REPL

1. `cmr install oracle-libs`
1. `cmr setup profile` and then update the new `./dev-system/profiles.clj`
   according to personal instructions provided by a CMR code developer.
1. `cmr setup dev`
1. `cmr start repl`
1. Once given a Clojure prompt, run `(reset)`

Note that the `reset` action could potentially take a while, not only due to
the code reloading for a large number of namespaces, but for bootstrapping
services as well as starting up worker threads.

#### Building and Running CMR Dev System from a Jar

Assuming you have already run the above steps (namely `cmr setup dev`), to
build and run the default CMR development system (`dev-system`) from a
`.jar` file:

1. `cmr build uberjars`
2. `cmr start uberjar dev-system`

See CMR Development Guide to read about specifying options and setting
environment variables

#### Building and Running separate CMR Applications

The following will build all of the applications but will put each jar into the
appropriate `target` directory for each application. The command shown in step
3 is an example. For the proper command to start up each application, see the
`Applications` section below. Note: Steps 1 and 2 only need to be completed
once.

1. `cmr build uberjar APP`
2. `cmr run uberjar APP`

Where `APP` is any supported CMR app. You can touble-tap the `TAB` key on
your keyboard to get the `cmr` tool to show you the list of availble apps
after entering `uberjar` in each step above.

## Checking Dependencies, Static Analysis, and Tests

There are several `lein` plugins that have been added to CMR for performing
various tasks either at individual subproject levels or at the top-level for
all subprojects.

#### Dependency Versions

To check for up-to-date versions of all project dependencies, you can use
`cmr test versions PROJ`, where `PROJ` is any CMR sub-project under the
top-level directory.

You may run the same command without a project to check for all projects:
`cmr test versions`.

Note that this command fails with the first project that fails. If many
subprojects are failing their dependency version checks and you wish to see
all of these, you may use your system shell:

```sh
for PROJ in `ls -1d */project.clj|xargs dirname`
do
  "Checking $PROJ ..."
  cmr test versions $PROJ
  cd - &> /dev/null
done
```

#### Dependency Ambiguities and `.jar` File Conflicts

To see if the JVM is having problems resolving which version of a
dependency to use, you can run `cmr test dep-tree PROJ`. To perform this
against all projects: `cmr test dep-trees`.

#### Static Analysis and Linting

To perform static analysis and linting for a project, you can run
`cmr test lint PROJ`. As above with dependency version checking, by
not passing a project, you can run for all projects: `cmr test lint`.

#### Testing CMR

There are two modes of testing the CMR:

* From the REPL
* Utilizing the CI/CD script to run against an Oracle database

For the first, the steps are as follows:

1. Ensure you have set up your development environment in `dev-system`
2. If you have built any `.jar` files, run `cmr clean PROJ` (for a given
   project) or `cmr clean` to clean all projects.
3. Start the REPL: `cmr start repl`
4. Once in the REPL, start the in-memory services: `(reset)`
5. Run the tests: `(run-all-tests)` or `(run-all-tests-future)`

Optionally, you could substitute the last step with `(run-suites)` which
uses a third-party tool to display test results more explicitly and with
easy copy/paste of tests for running individually (and with easier to read
exception messages/stacktraces). Here's an excerpt:

```
   cmr.system-int-test.ingest.provider-ingest-test
     update-provider-test
       assertion 1 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 2 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 3 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 4 ........................................................ [OK]
     delete-provider-test
       assertion 1 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 2 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 3 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 4 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 5 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 6 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 7 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 8 ........................................................ [OK]
       assertion 9 ........................................................ [OK]
```

For non-terminal based dev, depending upon your IDE/editor, you may have
shortcuts available to you for starting/restarting the services and/or running the
tests. To find out what these are you can contact a CMR core dev.

In order to run the tests against an Oracle database, it is recommended that
you use an Oracle VM built specifically for this purpose. You will also need
configuration and authentication information that will be set as environment
variables. Be sure to contact a CMR core dev for this information.

Once these are in place, you will be able to run the following:

```
$ cmr test cicd
```

Additionally, if you have an Oracle VM up and running, you can change how
the tests are run in the REPL by running the following:

```clj
user=> (reset :db :external)
...
user=> (run-all-tests)
...
```

Those tests will take much longer to run than when done with the in-memory
database (~25m vs. ~6m). To switch back to using the in-memory database,
simply call `(reset :db :in-memory)`.

There is also a different, optional test runner you can use. For more details see the docstring for `run-suites` in `dev-system/dev/user.clj` for usage instructions.

## Code structure

The CMR is made up of several small services called microservices. These are
small purposed-based services that do a small set of things well.

- For more reading on microservices: https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html

### The Microservices

Each microservice has a README file in its root directory, which provides a
short overview of the service's functionality. There are a number of main
applications, as well as several libraries and support applications.

#### Applications:

- access-control-app
  - The mechanism by which users are granted access to perform different
    operations in the CMR. Also maintains groups and access control rules.
    Note that users access is provided by either ECHO or URS as an external dependency. The mock-echo application implements both of the necessary interfaces for local testing.
  - Main method: cmr.access_control.runner

- bootstrap-app
  - Contains APIs for performing various bulk actions in the CMR
  - Main method: cmr.bootstrap.runner
  - See /bootstrap-app/README.md for a list of lein and uberjar commands

- cubby-app
  - Centralized caching for the CMR. Ideally each application will cache
    internally, but for situations that require centralized caching, we use
    Cubby.
  - Main method: cmr.cubby.runner

- dev-system
  - An app that combines together the separate microservices of the CMR into a
    single application to make it simpler to develop and run
  - Main method: cmr.dev_system.runner

- indexer-app
  - This handles indexing collections, granules, and tags in Elasticsearch
  - Main method: cmr.indexer.runner

- ingest-app
  - The Ingest app is responsible for collaborating with metadata db and indexer components of the CMR system to maintain the lifecycle of concepts
    coming into the system
  - Main method: cmr.ingest.runner

- search-app
  - Provides a public search API for concepts in the CMR
  - Main method: cmr.search.runner

- search-relevancy-test
  - Tests to measure and report the effectiveness of CMR's search relevancy algorithm

- system-int-test
  - Black-box, system-level tests to ensure functionality of the CMR

- virtual-product-app
  - Adds the concept of Virtual Products to the CMR. In short: Virtual
    Products represent products at a data provider that are generated on
    demand from users when they are ordered or downloaded through a URL
  - Main method: cmr.virtual_product.runner

- index-set-app
  - An application that maintains the set of indexes in elasticsearch for multiple concept types
  - Main method: cmr.index_set.runner

- metadata-db-app
  - A database that maintains revisioned copies of metadata for the CMR
  - Main method: cmr.metadata_db.runner

- mock-echo-app
  - This mocks out the ECHO REST API and the URS API as well. Its purpose is
    to make it easier to integration test the CMR system without having to run
    a full instance of ECHO. It won't mock it perfectly or completely. It will
    only implement the minimum necessary to enable integration testing.
  - Main method: cmr.mock_echo.runner

#### Libraries:

- acl-lib
  - Contains utilities for retrieving and working with ACLs

- common-app-lib
  - Contains utilities used within multiple CMR applications

- common-lib
  - Provides common utility code for CMR projects

- elastic-utils-lib
  - Most interfacing with Elasticsearch is done through this application

- es-spatial-plugin
  - An Elasticsearch plugin that enables spatial search entirely within elastic

- oracle-lib
  - Contains utilities for connecting to and manipulating data in Oracle

- orbits-lib
  - Clojure wrapper of a Ruby implementation of the Backtrack Orbit Search
    Algorithm (BOSA)

- message-queue-lib
  - A library for interfacing with RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, and an in-memory message queue

- spatial-lib
  - The spatial libraries provide utilities for working with spatial areas in the CMR

- transmit-lib
  - The Transmit Library defines functions for invoking CMR services

- umm-lib
  - This is the old source of UMM schemas and translation code. Since the
    advent of umm-spec-lib it is actively in the process of being removed

- umm-spec-lib
  - The UMM Spec lib contains JSON schemas that defined the Unified Metadata
    Model, as well as mappings to other supported formats, and code to migrate
    collections between any supported formats.
